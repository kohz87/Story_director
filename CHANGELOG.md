# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release: the tracker.

- **Tracker** of agendas, events, hooks, clocks, beats and secrets, written by the model as short `<Director>` change lines (`+` new, `~` changed, `-` resolved, `!` fired) that Story Block carries hidden in each reply. Anything the model leaves out stays unchanged.
- **Replay:** the tracker for any point in the chat is rebuilt from the change lines up to that reply, so swipes, edits, deletes and branches are always right. Cached per message.
- **Calendar:** Gregorian, or your own months, days and era; dates without a year take the nearest year.
- **The note,** before every reply: what is due and arriving, then the most relevant records (due, the scene's place, names in the scene, recent changes) within a token budget (1000 by default), secrets only as "do not reveal", and the change-line instructions.
- **Dormant shelf:** records unseen for 15 replies or 30 story days (both adjustable) leave the note until their name, place or date comes up again. Pinned records never go dormant.
- **Checks** on every reply: unknown keys, duplicates, due items left unfired or missed, dates written outside on/due/arrive, overlong parts, a missing `<Director>` block while something was due.
- **Director tab** in Story Block's sidebar, **settings**, **Seed from World State** (turns an existing World State's Off-Screen, World, Hooks and Clocks lines into records), and an **Off-Screen mirror** for NPC State Delta (on by default).
